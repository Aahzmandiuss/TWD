# TWD
The V:TES tournament winning decks

If you want to contribute, create pull requests with the changes. Be sure to add the URL of the source of the TWD (usually vekn.net) in each entry.

To add a TWD, you must insert a line such at this one at the right place (located near the top of the file)

<pre>
&lt;a href=#2016cavvb&gt;Ravel Zorzal's Conservative Agitation: Vila Velha, Brazil October 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
         --------- ------------   #------------#--------  #----#----  #----- ------------
            alias      winner name    tournament name        city    country  month and year
</pre>
The alias is the id of the event in the event calendar.

(Previously, it was built with the year and the first letter of the tournament name and city / country, marked with # in the example above, which would give: 2016cavvb)

Then you must insert at the right place the tournament entry itself (located after the entries above):

All the following lines are mandatory, and the order must be correct:
<ul>
         <li>Tournament name</li>
         <li>City, Country (or place, City, Country)</li>
         <li>Date</li>
         <li>Format (2R+F or 3R+F)</li>
         <li># players</li>
         <li>Winner name</li>
         <li>URL to the TWD</li>
</ul>
If the deck creator's name is the same as the winner's name, it can be omitted after the Deck name.
