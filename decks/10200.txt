The second installment of the European Championship Week of Nightmares Helsinki 2022 took place, like every part of the warm-up tournament tour, outside Helsinki, namely in Espoo, the second biggest city in Finland. The venue was a pub in Tapiola that has hosted several similar events before.

There was room for 20 players, and with the great turnout of 18 players, the limit was almost reached. There was also a wide variety of players from veterans all the way to second generation methuselahs. As is typical for Finland, there were many walls and combat decks in the tournament, the winner being something in between.

The final table:

 -- Tommi Hakomaa: Khurshid Legionnaires 0.5
 -- Teemu Sainomaa: Gangrel anarch wall 0.5
 -- Marko Saari: Mambo Jeanne rush 0.5
 -- Esa-Matti Smolander: Giotto & princes vote 0.5
 -- Niko Vanhatalo: Brujah anarch bleed 0.5
