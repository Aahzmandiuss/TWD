Description: Based on Bram Van Stappen Nacional de Espa√±a 2021 deck. The main change was in the crypt to prioritize the superior OBF and some of the library to adapt it to the Chilean game.

Possible changes:
1. Creepshow was never necessary though maybe it was just luck.
2. It would be nice to make room for one more Reckless.
3. Trade Athena for one more copy of Arishat
4. Cryptic Rider gave me a table but it's a matter of taste
5. Entrancement was never played, despite having it, always prioritize policies, therefore it could come out.
6. My original idea was to play 9 Ashur, but it's not critical either.

Thanks to Bram for creating and sharing his deck, Backwinder & VTES Conce for the testing, analysis and good vibes, Posco Work for the policy analysis, and especially Faroock!
