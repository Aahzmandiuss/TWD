Deck Name: Nefertiti & Grosminet

A very exciting final table, where everyone was out to get VPs and I ended up last man standing: far from those finals where everybody waits for the time limit! Congrats to all involved.

This deck is not your usual kind of stealth-bleed. It can be underestimated even when your opponents know it, and can have some devastating turns even with few minions. Also, way more interesting and technical to play than usual S&B.
Heart of the City should go out, you never have the tempo to use it. Should probably become one more Enticement.
Perfectionnist is only useful if you remember to use it...
