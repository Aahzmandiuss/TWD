Deck Name: Unspecified Platinum Snakes
Author: Lukas Simandl
Description: This is the third iteration of this pack and by far the most successful and also my favorite. In the first iteration, I dropped cards requiring Unnamed. It's generally a problem to have things in there that only Unnamed can play and not untap after, there's no room for any extra multi actions and it's better to hold untap card for next turn. The cards that left were replaced with Platinum Protocols and I increased the number of Revelation of the Serpent, a card that allowed me to reduce the number of stealth.
The deck isn't hard to play, pop Unnamed, become anarch, bleed with Platinum Protocol each turn, untap, and keep Archon Investigation and Party out of Bounds in hand. Unnamed plus one extra Vampire is enough, definitely no need to draw a third, better to keep 20 pools for "defense".
