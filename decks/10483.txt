Deck Name: AUS Nosset
Description: I wanted to build a deck that can deal most of its damage without any Directed actions. I also like some reactions, so Baali based vote was off the table. First built as a fun deck, surprised me at some test games and performed well in the tournament. The deck is quite strong in the late game and can sway the table to your favor with a couple of well placed Parity Shifts and some table talk.

Warsaw Station is the most important card in the deck. Might want to add fourth. Telepathic Vote Counting is bad, replace those with something else. Maybe Cryptic Rider and one more political action?
