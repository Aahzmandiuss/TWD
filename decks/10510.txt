Deck Name: Web of Fists
Description: Breed the recruits and punch anybody blocking your swarm of bleeds. I went against more magnums than I'd like and really missed the celerity as a lot of the crypt doesn't have it. Running this again I'd trim the Potence and replace the discipline masters with celerity.
