5 years ago I organized my first tournament at the same venue. So this was a celebratory event of sorts. Nice amount of people showed up and I personally enjoyed every round. Finals was super tight! And a nice artist provided us with some prices.

Finals seating:
Otso Saariluoma(Tzimisce)
Antti Penttilä(Ministry)
Lauri Salmi(Garou rim's winning deck)
Jyri Puhakka(new Brujah)
Tommi Hakomaa(Martins Bruce de guy deck)

In the finals Antti managed to snatch 2VP's and Tommi got GW+3.(More info later)
