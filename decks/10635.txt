Positively surprising number of people gathered to enjoy some games of VTES, even on a short notice. Four player tables didn't slow the pace at all and games were as intense as ever.

The finals was definitely one of the tightest of our games in a while, keeping everyone at the edge of their seats until the very last minutes of the game. Congratulations to Peetu for winning and reaching the Hall of Fame!

Finals Seating:
Aapo JÃ¤rvelin (Pre Tzimisce Vote/toolbox) --> Emma Takkunen (Mithras Bleed) --> Noora Hirvonen (Weenie Auspex) --> Petrus Makkonen (Arika + Watenda Alastor) --> Simo Tiippana (Big Cap Dom/Obf bleed + tricks)

Winners Deck List:

Deck Name: Watenda Alastor
Description: It's a control deck, where Maris and Watenda play key roles. Aim for a three-way, as control does, with your preferred frenemies. Arika is there for extra votes, end-game bleed and to punish Gangrel Barons for their locations. Worth it.
ECTU should be Carlton, mainly for contest. Flamethrower is superior in the Girls matchup - diablerize them after the rush instead of trying to grind them out with Assault Rifle. Adjust the vote-push to your liking and local meta.
