Deck Name: Vasiliy sabe donde vives

Description:
This is a bleed deck whose main objective is to make redirecting and reducing bleed very expensive.
It relies on the cards Suspension of Disbelief and Narrow Minds to achieve the goal.
I added a Libertas since the deck is packed with a couple of Anarchs, so with this combo
a typical Telepathic Misdirection or Deflection costs 3 or 4 blood.
