Finals seating:
Maaike (Dowager & friends toolbox - Roy (Tupdogs & Nephandi) - Jeroen (Ministry Anarch Stealth Bleed) - Steffen (Goratrix Anarch Wall) - Florian (G2/3 Weenie Computer Hacking)

Florians Weenies bled fast and hard, removing 10+ pool before Maaike had her first Vampire out. Dowager & co turned out to have lots of untaps and rushes, so quickly the 1 and 2 caps went to torpor, but they kept coming. The tupdogs + Nepahndi played it slowly early game, focussing on getting Antonio some Nephandi + in the ready reagion, and ensuring to always have a ready tup dog. Jeroen just tried to go forward and bleed, as long as he still had vampires, but Goratrix had many telepathic misdirections to send to his prey.

After Roy removed one of Maaikes 2 vampires , she could really only defend the little pool left. The Tupdogs now started to rush forward, slowly removing Jeroens ousting capacity by eating torporized minions with Nephandi. Goratrix with Anarch Revolt and Enkil Cog managed to stop Florans possible oust with an eagle sight, followed with an Erciyes Fragment-stolen Computer Hacking to oust Florian. Maaike was ousted quickly afterwards, Steffen looking very healthy at about 20 pool.

Jeroens last minion was put in torpor by Roy, and then Jeroen was ousted by Nephandi bleeds for 1 and Antonio using the Codex of the Edenic Groundskeepers. In the 1 vs 1 with Roy and Steffen, both Omaya and Goratrix were put to torpor by Tupdogs, and eaten by the Nehpandi. Without any minions left to defend, his own Anarch revolt in play and 8 bleed per turn on the table, Steffen conceded.
