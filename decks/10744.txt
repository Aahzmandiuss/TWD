Deck Name: Fists of the Giovanni
Description: A version of a Weenie Potence based on the G5-G6 vamps. I had tried a version with Computer Hacking and tried for this tournament to replace them with permableed and 1 Heidelberg. I also addressed their blood problem, and included Carver’s but also Coven, after some hesitation: bad idea, should be ditched. Went down from 2 Frontal to just 1, but maybe it should be none, it’s always a risky bet.
