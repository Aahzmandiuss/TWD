Finals seating:

Arnold Riegler (Mary Anne Blair multiact) -> Richard Stefan Utner (Capuchin and friends, hand size + bleed) -> Martin Weinmayer (Lasombra vote/bleed) -> Florian Koller (The Unnamed / Great Beast / Soul Gem) -> Julian Schneider (Weenie Anarch, Night Moves, Propaganda of the deeds)

After a fast start Julians weenie Obfuscate damaged Arnold hard, so that he couldn't do much, the permanent Intercept from The Capuchin even made things even worse for him. Still he managed to generate pool and at least stay in the game for a long time.

Afterwards the momentum shifted highly in the favor of The Unnamed, having free reign against the weenies and Lasombra. But after Martin deflected 3 big bleeds in 1 turn from Richard Stefan to the Unnamed, he was capable of finishing him off in his next turn, but being very low on blood. Afterwards Julian also fell prey to Martin and it looked like yet another win for the 2 times European Champion.

Still, Arnold remained gaining enough pool to avoid an oust and after constant pressure of beeing bled hard, finally Martin fell to Richard Stefan and with 20 Minutes to go, Arnold also couldn't withstand the pressure anymore and being eliminated, with the Prince of Vienna, Richard Stefan Utner getting the win.
