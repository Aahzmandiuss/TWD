Deck Name: Carna & friends
Description: Classic Carna Grinder deck, nothing exceptional. I built the deck, played it once in a friendly game, did some modifications, and played it only once more before the tournament.
I wasn't expecting the meta that I saw (warzone), but more a varied meta (some combat rush, some vote, some bleed, not too much intercept).
It was a total failure my reading of the meta, but I managed to profit from the other players rushing each other (I generaly waited till the other player's vampires where in torpor to launch my bleeds).

1x Masika St. John            3  THA                        Tremere:3

-- in general not very happy with the 6-cap vampires in the crypt (althoug on paper it looks good). All of them will go out except Selena, which I will increase by 1. Probably will add some small Tremere.

Library (80 cards)
Master (12)
1x Academic Hunting Ground
1x Anarch Troublemaker
1x Arcane Library
4x Blood Doll
1x Chantry
1x Direct Intervention
1x Misdirection -- will go, didn't find it useful
1x Pentex(TM) Subversion -- will add another one
1x Powerbase: Montreal

-- overall happy with the master module, I will probably add 2x Wider View (because it's triffle, I can cycle the crypt and it helps me pool a little bit)

Action (15)
12x Govern the Unaligned -- will remove 2 govern
3x Magic of the Smith -- will add 1x MotS

Ally (2)
1x Carlton Van Wyk
1x Ponticulus

-- nothing to say, great value

Equipment (4)
1x Bowl of Convergence
1x Heart of Nizchetus
1x Ivory Bow
1x Sniper Rifle

-- will add 1x Kevlar Vest. removed it from the first version and I regret.

Action Modifier (8)
3x Bonding -- -1 bonding, 2 should be enough
4x Conditioning
1x Foreshadowing Destruction -- will go

-- need to add 2x Mirror Walk

Reaction (27)
3x Deflection
2x Delaying Tactics
2x Eagle's Sight
6x Eyes of Argus -- -1
2x Forced Awakening
3x My Enemy's Enemy
3x On the Qui Vive
6x Telepathic Misdirection -- -1

-- I think I should remove some bounce and wake to have better proportions regarding other cards

Combat (12)
4x Apportation
1x Flames of the Netherworld -- will go, didn't find it useful
7x Theft of Vitae

-- I overall feel that the combat module is enough. In a low combat environment it largely does the job. Most of the time combat is cycled against S:CE to try and draw some reactions.
