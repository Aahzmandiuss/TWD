Deck Name: Water Dog - Ben Pealing the Ghost of Adam Hulse
Author: Kelly Lyons, Ben Peal and Adam Hulse
Description: I started with a deck list from Ben Peal. Here is the link to that deck: https://vdb.im/decks/2018u2bma

He calls the deck, “Defend the Ghosts!”.  However, when I asked Ben about the changes I made to his deck, he answered me with, “Oh goodness...I didn't even build that deck.  I borrowed it from a friend.” That friend was Adam Hulse. Hence the name of the deck, “Water Dog - Ben Pealing the Ghost of Adam Hulse”.

The following are the cards from Ben and Adam’s deck that aren’t in my deck list:
Minion Tap
Powerbase: Montreal
Masquer
Wake with Evening's Freshness

The following are cards from my deck that aren’t in Ben and Adam’s deck list:
Admonitions, The
Barrens, The
Charisma
Giant's Blood
Liquidation
Metro Underground
Freak Drive
Eagle's Sight
Funeral Wake
FBI Special Affairs Division

The big difference between the two decks is the use of masters. I have an Admonitions in every Sabbat deck I build. Freak drive is probably my favorite card in the game or at least it’s one of the most used. I do play with many fortitude decks. I play the deck slowly and try to get three vampires in play while bringing out legionnaires. Build a wall and block actions. Build an army then bleed.
