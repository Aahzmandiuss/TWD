-- Thank you to all the participants for joining the tournament.
-- We had guest from Osijek Croatia making this tournament international.
-- Although we planed to have +10min per elimination extension finales were done in less then 2h mark.
-- The final seating was as follows:
-- Miloš Krstić (99 Problems)
-- Dušan Kosanović(Nefertiti variant - Stealth Bleed)
-- Milan Popović (Rafael de Corazon variant - Bleed Toolbox)
-- Nikica Novaković(Alexandra variant - Bleed Toolbox)
-- Višnja Ilić (Magaji vote variant - Politics)
-- Finales started off with fast removal of Milan Popović. As Rafale was left in locked state by Alexandra, he had no defenses against Dušan.  The rest of the game was marked with slow Death of  Nikica, as he struggled to maintain his position with Nefertiti bleed on his neck. Life boon was deployed in order to save Nikica, but alas, his end was foreseen. While Višnja was protected with Protected Resources Miloš had time to remove the Advantage Dušan acuminated, leaving us with expected domination of Emerald Legionnaire.

Deck Name : 99 Problems
Author : Milos Krstic
Description :
"If you're having card flow problems, I feel bad for you son,
I got ninety-nine problems but the deck ain't one."

I would like to note that Ashur Tablets and Emerald Legionnaire are perfectly balanced cards in their current form
and i am looking forward to competitively playing them in the years to come!
