Description:
"I don't trust nobody but God, all these Legionnaires parked in my yard
Swear last night I swimmed in that Ashurs, then woke up in TWDA."
- DJ Khalid al-Rashid

I am of the opinion that Creeping Sabotage needs to be errata'd since it is too powerful
and can get anyone a tournament win.
