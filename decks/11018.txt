Deck Name: Schizo Whispers
Description: "Demented one goes faster"

-- Thank you to all the participants for joining the tournament.
-- We had guests from Osijek Croatia making this tournament international.
-- The final seating was as follows:
-- Milutin Melka (V5 Banu Haqim- wall)
-- Miloš Krstić (V5 Gangrel - wall)
-- Miloš Živković (V5 Tzimisce - toolbox)
-- Srdjan Milojević (Schizo Whispers)
-- Milan Popović Ilić (G2-3 Harbingers of the Scull - bleed)
-- The Final started with the fast removal of Milan Popović. Srdjan had an "information highway" from the start, going fast with 1,2,3 from the start. There were some efforts to slow down Srdjan, but alas, Milan was eliminated. The rest of the game was going slower, with 3 wall decks and 1 bleed. A good time was spent on negotiations and with 10 min extension it was not used for new moves on the board.
-- With this, are we seeing the return of the Malkavians with dementation? time will tell.
