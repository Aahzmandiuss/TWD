Nice small tournament to finish off the year. Very aggressive meta as always. Lots of bleed, some brutal combat and some politics. Very fast games overall, finished the tournament almost 2 hours before expected.

The Finals was a tight game, and it could have ended in many ways. But Mari Tiippana rose to the occasion and took the victory quite convincingly, after a dominating performance on the preliminary rounds.

Finals Seating:
Lasse PÃ¶yry (Ghede Typhonic Beast rush) --> Mari Tiippana (MidCap Dem bleed) --> Petrus Makkonen (Synesios vote) --> Pasi Karjalainen (G6 Malkavian bleed) --> Toni Karjalainen (Scout + Unmada Shattering Crescendo)

Deck Name: Malks!
Author: Mari Tiippana - Simo Tiippana
Description: This deck was originally designed to be played by new players. But when I saw, how they managed to handle it, I decided to give it a try myself in a tournament. I just added some Touch of clarities, Dreams of the Sphinxes, Delaying Tacticses and a Wash.
