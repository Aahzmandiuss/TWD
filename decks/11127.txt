Deck name: Gangrel Things
Description: Thank you Aapo Järvelin (Khormag) for handing me the predecessor of this deck in the after-games of a tournament he organized in Joensuu a couple of years back, the deck is super fun to play. I played versions of it quite a lot in 2022, and last months I have had a feeling it could do well in the grindy Stockholm meta with its fast and plentiful actions and reactions. This iteration though I feel like I made slightly worse by adding some random cards outside of the core mechanic of Computer hacking, Thing and Earth meld, but it did hold itself together this time.
