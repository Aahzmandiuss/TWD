Deck Name: Guardian LSFM
Description:  A Matasuntha Wall deck that is inspired by Le Sserafim's The Gaurdian. It aims to block key actions and send key vampires to torpor in order to bloat, relieve pressure, and clear away blockers. Once it gets it's rhythm going, it can run through the deck pretty fast which necessitates the inclusion of Ashur Tablets and Parthenon. The Baron package helps to get an early oust via bounce.

The combat package is diversion, hell-for-leather, and trap. Diversion and hell-for-leather are two of the most versatile anarch combat cards that Matasuntha can run. Trap is there to counter grinder decks that depend on fortitude. Dog Pack takes care of S:CE. Basically, when Matasuntha gets into combat, pool gain is essentially guaranteed.
