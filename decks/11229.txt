-- 2GW8 + 3vp in final

Deck Name: Hesha's trinket emporium
Description:
1. (as of 2024) NRA does not extend to equip actions.
2. Free repeatable unlocks are a scourge upon the land and multiply the value of an opportunity window to incredible heights.
3. The above two points culminate in a card shuffle simulation experience for most preys of this deck. I guess an early end to the round means more time to rest?

Shaves 6 cards based on a discussion with Darby Keeney.

Many thanks to him for pointing me to Hag's Wrinkles and discussing card flow with me for the last couple of years.

Tech, of course, comes from both at this point.

It's been a blast.
