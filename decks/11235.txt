Deck Name: Knowledge is power
Description: Here's my list... be careful, it's far from a tier 1 deck ^^ I clearly benefit from tables with decks that have enough impact to pick up the crumbs at the end of the game.
For the final, it was largely the initial placement that allowed me to win.

Note that I'm going to try and find room for 1/2 more Obedience.
For the record, it all started with a Troglodytia cept/fight deck that didn't work, and Alex Jr (aka Bloups) suggested I cohabit with Capuchin, and he was right, the two get on pretty well.
