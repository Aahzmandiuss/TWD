Deck Name: Fire in the Belly
Description:
This deck is a Malgorzata deck inspired by Le Sserafim's Fire in the Belly and Kim Chaewon's iconic "Piona, neo nae dongnyoga dwaera!" (Fearnot, join my crew) line from the same song. The idea came from a Facebook comment on my last TWDA post from Luis Jimenez on how Fire in the Belly and Dragon's Breath can be my next LSFM deck. Since I was already doing aggravated damage, I figured that I can level up the song reference by throwing in some graverobbing to force people to "Join my crew". Since I was already playing with Viscissitude and Dominate, it made sense to use Malgorzata and Friends. The deck is specifically designed for the Philippine Meta with Rotschreck and Telepathic Tracking to handle combat ends and Rego Motum to survive against the heavier combat decks. Lord Tremere helped Malgorzata use her ability without losing too much tempo, while Mistress Fanchon was there to fish out specific cards when I need them. The 6 Villeins helped me sustain my pool together with the Deflections and Auspex Package. Graverobbing and then getting back 5 pool with Villein can be back breaking.
