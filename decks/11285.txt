Deck Name: Water Dog - Illegal Tactics
Description: My prince, Norm Brown, won a tournament in Vidor in 2022 with a Brujah Illegalism Deck. He relied on Reckless Agitation as a second action. Here is his deck list. https://vdb.im/decks/10090

It was good. I, however, have never been a big fan of Reckless Agitation as Karl Schaefer knows. We’ve had that debate. Instead, I prefer Line Brawl. The ability to bleed with Illegalism unlock then Line Brawl for a pool is just too good. Line Brawl also, gives you an enters combat action and even +1 bleed action. It is the best Brujah action card for anarchs.

I agree with Norm when it comes to Chemistry discipline cards. You get that extra stealth plus it allows you to Dabbler so, if you get blocked with Illegalism you can unlock and still do Line Brawl.

I added a couple of CrimethInc. cards for more unlock. Saku and Valeriya have protean and if you get lucky Brandon Grime has thaumaturgy. That’s why there is 2 of him in the crypt.
