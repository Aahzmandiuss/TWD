Deck Name: The Gold(man) Standard
Description:
I really wanted to take one of my favorite cards (Undue Influence) and one of my favorite vampires (Laura Goldman) and just build a fun deck that tends to last way longer than you'd expect in combat, way longer than you'd expect on the table and is super fun to play. Build up your play space with the 3 caps, get that first baron out and just play smart. If I were to make any changes to the deck, I'd drop the one Chameleon and put in a second Monkey Wrench, having that available quicker with Garibaldi has always benefited me. Shout out to Dean Garrison for loaning me two Protection Rackets before the tournament to replace the two very mediocre Touch of Pain I had in there initially.
