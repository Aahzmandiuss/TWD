The annual Easter event has somehow become a milestone of personal redemptions. First this was two years ago where I made it to the HoF, then last year my oldest proper tournament deck's first win. Now, it was my last remaining "clich√©" deck's turn.

My personal expectations for the day were very low: mainly just to successfully organize and somehow stay awake. Namely, I had spent the previous week in Eurovision parties in Spain and only returned home in the early hours of morning. I could have played a lot better in a better state of awareness, but luckily having played this deck in tournaments since forever, it also largely played itself.

Throughout the tournament, the MVP of the deck was Secure Haven, and the final especially would have been completely unwinnable without it. The crypt is a bit unconventional but I'm very satisfied with it.
