Deck Name: Defy the Edict of Worms

Description: This is an evolution of a previous Museum-Manse design, now with more Dominate! The library is currently formatted for the Gulf Coast's untimed finals format. A more tuned version with a thinner library is already being tested.  The deck should also get better as the crypt rounds out.

With 9 S:CE combat cards, 7 pre-range combat ends effects from Living Manse, air cover from Powerbase: Savannah, and 2 copies of One with the Land; the vampires tend to be resilient. Despite sitting near several combat decks, only 1 vampire hit torpor though 4 rounds of play. In many games, I had more blood gain than I could use.

The tiny political module was intended to address Gangrel walls and assorted swarm decks. I never used either card and have ideas for replacements.

1x Whisper          5  ANI DOM pro             Tzimisce:6
1x Prentis Derby    4  ani dom pro             Tzimisce:6

-- Adrino’s press and Marialena’s detriment require planning to counter. Stephen Bateson is a terrible placeholder for an anything better. I’m hoping for a second [DOM][PRO] vampire at 7 cap in the next card release.
