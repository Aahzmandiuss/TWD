Deck Name: A Fortnight of Bad Dreams
Created by:  Darby Keeney
Credits: Karl Schaefer (revision)
Description:  V2: “To Absurdity and Beyond!”

The deck is hyper-focused on offense. I block with my pool, so Villein to 1 blood, pool gain late game via Break the Bonds and bolus injections of 6 pool is the extent of my defense. If I haven't gone to plaid, something is wrong.

Shortly before the tournament, Karl Schaefer suggested removing the stealth locations. It is counterintuitive; I wanted that first bleed to hit, but saving 2 MPA and 4 pool is undeniably attractive. This change worked well with a bit of in-game play adjustment.

Until you understand how BtB creates hand management issues once you reach 3 minions, it's hard to describe optimal play for this deck. But I've got a very minor library adjustment to test if I can stomach playing this monstrosity again.

I'll not provide detailed meta/situational adjustments. If you're smart enough to play V:TES, you're smart enough to figure those out on your own.
