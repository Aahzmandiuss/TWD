Description: Anarch-based Gangrel Wall (5 Baron Crypt).
After two long days and with a budding headache, I needed something more fault tolerant for Sunday.  So I reused an existing deck. Texans don't think allies are robust, so I could drop the Uncoiling for a duplicate Garibaldi. Proved to be a pretty good choice.

Game play is as expected... survive your way to victory.
