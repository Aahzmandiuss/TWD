-- 3vp in final

Deck Name: Zürich Bonds

Description: Nu Ravnos bleed with an emphasis on breed rather than quick big bleeds (e.g. Dabbler & PB Zürich). Codex and Break the Bonds are a match made in hell. The Feral Hounds were definitely worth their cardslots. I joined the tournament rather spontaneously, so I could not make adjustments: Night Terrors should be Delaying Tactics, I'd probably exchange Barrens for a Hunting Ground and slightly adjust the stealth mix, but it worked fine as it is.
