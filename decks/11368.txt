-- 1GW4.5 + 3vp in final

Deck Name: Guardian LSFM 2.0
Description:
Having been sick for 2 weeks prior to the tournament, I didn't have time to brew another deck so I took the Matasuntha deck that won me the January Tournament for another spin. The deck has been performing really well during casual play and the nerf to Ashur Tablets did open up 8 spots in the decklist. I decided to fill these with anti-manuever/equipment tech in drawing out the beast and voracious vermin. These changes made combat flow smoother against celerity guns and grinder variants.
