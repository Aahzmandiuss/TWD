Deck Name: Matasuntha Makes it Look Easy
Description: The third iteration of Matasuntha deck was geared towards having the ability to rush and torpor multiple vampires in the same turn while keeping the same defensive energy that has won me a couple of tournaments this competitive season. I was expecting a lot of weenie or stealth bleed decks together with the usual combat heavy meta in the Philippines and so I wanted to take a more proactive approach in taking control of the table. The decision to add more rush cards and diversify them was made specifically to handle both.

For those who're counting along, Matasuntha gained me a total of 35 pool over 4 rounds of play. I wouldn't have survived 3 of the 4 rounds without her.
