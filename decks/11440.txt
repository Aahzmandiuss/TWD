Deck Name: Alpha Beta
Created by: Darby Keeney
Credits: Kelly Schultz for review, but his changes were rejected.
Description: V1.4 WON 24 Build.

Finally gave in and dropped the Zephyrs for Org Resist, dropped a Manifest for another bounce and considering Saku's [for] swapped one Dust up for Diversion.  Otherwise largely unchanged from previous versions despite hating the Thrown Gates most of the time.

Honestly the Org Resists could be On the Qui Vive and it wouldn't make much difference, but whatever.

Action Modifier (6)
6x Power of One -- oddly valuable both for output and increasing bleed success

Reaction (8)
6x Bait and Switch -- added copies in concession to V5 meta

-- The bounce reactions still rely largely on either Aline's special or Powerbase: LA for unlocks.  Can be fragile but backrushing is also an option against aggressive predators.
