Deck Name: Six Demon Bag #2
Description: Vintage deck slightly modified for V5 meta. I wasn't sure this would be fast enough for 2024 but with some careful play it still works.

I prefer this updated classic over more recent Anarch variants. I like the strong text on the 3 larger wingmen, value getting around bleed reduction with Hordes and appreciate how Tend the Flock helps manage overhead costs.
