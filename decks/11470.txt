-- 2GW8 + 2vp in final

Deck Name: Y.A.F.T.P.D.
Description: "Funda-Fist" revision.
Credits: Antti Penttil√§, Karl Schaefer and Kelly Schultz for discussion/review of previous versions.

This combat module is largely prototypical, but adjusted for Hunger + maneuver + additional strike per rush/block card. I'll miss some blocks, get combats from bleeding and maybe have fights requiring added flexibility - so it's not real math. But whole thing is stupidly polyvalent.

I don't re-adjust to any fixed ratio during play. Decisions are more about immediate effectiveness and looking forward 1-2 actions/reactions when possible.

Crypt (12 cards, min=20, max=34, avg=6.67)

-- Funmi really rounds out this crypt and usually feels like the star vampire.
-- Wish I could get rid of Warmaksan, but any 5-cap prince is awfully good.

Library (90 cards)
Master (15; 8 trifle)
2x Alamut -- defense before offense
1x Direct Intervention
1x Giant's Blood -- Better me than them
3x Haqim's Law: Retribution -- Enough in this version
2x Priority Contract -- Been the right number so far, 3 caused hand jam
6x Villein -- This could increase to 7 and the deck might be better

Action (5)
5x Hunter's Mark

Equipment (2)
1x Bowl of Convergence -- half the crypt has [aus/AUS]
1x Sport Bike

-- Both work better than Market Square when playing 2nd Trad, if you can afford the equip action

Political Action (5)
4x Camarilla's Iron Fist -- incredible midgame potential, even if not realized this weekend
1x Disputed Territory

Action Modifier (3)
3x Forgotten Labyrinth -- critical for Hunter's Mark with crypt's prevalent [obf] drawback

Action Modifier/Combat (10)
6x Resist Earth's Grasp
4x Swallowed by the Night -- More [CEL] than [OBF] means more Resists

Reaction (9)
9x Second Tradition: Domain -- prototypical BH Prince card count

Combat (39)
3x Blur
16x Hunger of Marduk
2x Lightning Reflexes -- Just can't drop these, they always make a difference
3x Psyche! -- just enough to make Form of Mist/Majesty think twice
7x Pursuit
3x Quickness -- I sometimes wonder about this card's errata and a deck might result
3x Rego Motum
2x Zip Gun -- love this wrinkle

Event (2)
1x NSA Trio -- I can't tell you how often this buys a turn without predation
1x Scourge of the Enochians -- replaced Aranthebes when Iron Fist replaced Ancilla/Anarchist
