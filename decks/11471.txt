Deck Name: Water Dog - Manipulating the Beast
Description: Gulf Coast Roast Grand Prix – Mississippi – 3rd Leg

My previous Gangrel Deck was “Unscrupulous Behavior in the Wild” which had a similar crypt. With this deck I decided to let André the Manipulator shine. The +2 cards for your hand is too good when it’s so easy to make him anarch, unlock, act again, defend, etc. Utilizing THING and Effective Management helped me put Andre into play every round including the final.

For this crypt I dropped Martina Srnankova, Mickey Wheeler, and Hanna Nokelainen. I added 2X Andre and Massimiliano. Massimiliano, although higher in cost than what I wanted to pay would be another baron added to help play Bait and Switch.

The library was completely different in many ways except for THING and Deep Ecology. Starting with master cards the big change was adding 2X Garibaldi-Meucci Museum. Why wasn’t that in my other Gangrel Deck??? I also, added a Pentex(TM) Subversion which came up big in the final. However, this is a reduced master card package as I went from 16 master cards to 14.

I added Break the Bonds, Open War, and Constant Revolution reducing the number of THINGS and Skullduggeries. The combat package was completely overhauled to add Concealed Weapons with .44 Magnums. Open War with guns was really important in the finals.
