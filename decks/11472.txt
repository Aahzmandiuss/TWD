-- 2GW7 + 4vp in final

Deck Name: Flakes
Inspired by: Based on a deck Mehdi Mazni played in the 2018 NAC finals, which appears to have roots in decks from Malween Douchy (2009) and Pawel Kukielczynski (2010)
Description: LiqTab Combat ally swarm, postnerf and V5 tuned.

I've been running variants of this deck since seeing Mehdi run his during the 2018 NAC finals. I've made finals with them but hadn't won until this less combat-focused V5 version saw the light of day.

Most recent changes are summarized inline below.

Crypt (12 cards, min=13, max=22, avg=4.5)
-----------------------------------------
5x Antonio d'Erlette  5  THA dom for pot  Tremere antitribu:4
2x Isanwayen          6  DOM MYT OBT      Kiasyd:4
1x Janine             4  aus dom tha      Tremere antitribu:4
1x Mosfair            4  cel dom tha      Tremere antitribu:4
1x Ember Wright       3  aus dom          Tremere antitribu:3
1x Keith Moody        3  DOM              Tremere antitribu:4
1x Saiz               3  aus dom          Tremere antitribu:3

-- Isanwayen is a "break glass in case of emergency" Parthenon + Deflection machine. Never showed in any round this time.

Library (70 cards)
Master (30; 1 trifle)
9x Ashur Tablets -- dropped to 9 copies post nerf, plan for 2 sets.
1x Bleeding the Vine -- why should anyone else complete the Tablets?
1x Creepshow Casino -- marginal hard-recruit tool, unknown value.
1x Direct Intervention
3x Dreams of the Sphinx
1x Frontal Assault -- simply huge in this build, won game 2.
2x Haven Uncovered -- also important in games 2, 3 and 4.
1x Jake Washington
4x Liquidation
4x Parthenon, The
2x Shard, London, The -- terrible interpretation IMO, but play as ruled.
1x Villein -- marginal, should probably be Wider View

-- I used to run an Information Highway to dribble pool onto vampires while still crapping out Nephandi.  Probably should replace the Creepshow Casino.

Ally (10)
1x Carlton Van Wyk
9x Nephandus

Equipment (1)
1x Heart of Nizchetus -- I never took time to get this, but I think it is important?

Action Modifier (4)
4x Mirror Walk -- I didn't used to play these, but the no-combat clause opens options.

Reaction (14)
8x Deflection -- increased for the current meta
2x Delaying Tactics -- crucial in the finals
4x On the Qui Vive

Combat (8)
8x Target Vitals -- Trap isn't V5 meta, this is the combat pump. Doesn't feel excessive.

Event (3)
3x Unmasking, The -- yeah, this does a thing and still deserves a nerf
