Deck Name: Paw Patrol: El(ä)intenluovuttaja
Created by: Antti Penttilä
Description: Kuyén gets dog pack(s) and Luciano moves them around as needed and then you control the flow of the game (and profit) in this combat ends heavy meta without much other combat around.

I played Antti's deck in this tourney because I thought it was a cool deck when I saw it on a live tourney and wanted to give it a go. I added Rewilding to the deck which came in handy in prelims, but sometimes I felt like "I wish this was a deep song".
