-- 2GW6 + 4vp in final

First tournament of the recently created Powerbase Vila Velha, where we have eight new players and an old war vampire coming out of torpor. To the surprise of the already experienced mathusalens, the young people showed what they knew how to do, placing 3 of them in the final of a sixteen-player tournament.
The final was chaotic, with the two old VTES players showing all their infamy and cunning by making deals with the newcomers or negotiating for seemingly innocent actions to pass.
The brujah player made the table help him survive malk94's incessant bleeds until he managed to destroy all his vampires, and with a situational bleed (and many bouncer's) he killed Stanislava, the gangrel player no longer had much luck in effectively attacking the ventrue who incessantly made life, until a table situation allowed him to kill both the malk94 and the brujah sequentially, in the redzap the gangrel with 3 life was unable to block a kine, after 4 attempts by the ventrue and he also gave in ...

TABLE:
Stanislava > Gangrel v5 > Ventrue Lawfirm > Malk 94 > Euro Brujah g5/6
