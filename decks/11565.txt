Deck Name: Fix the Problem at the Source (Safety-Net Version)
Description: Arishat + Barons + Protected Resources

Jan Bjørndalen and I were discussing how to make Arishat + Barons work in the current bleed-heavy meta.  I had previously tried a Protected Resource version of the deck, but thought it would be worthwhile since the last go.  I had previously cut the deck down to 66 cards from 73, so I had some room to alter this a bit.  Also thanks to Sérgio Martins for feedback and suggestions.

Notes:
No Arishat in the opening draw in round 2 or the finals.  Managed to find her in the finals.  Wider View needs to be added back to the deck.  Not sure why I dropped it.

Recursion is still broken.  I don't win any of these games today without recycling cards via Garibaldi-Meucci Museum.

Jacques Rouge's lack of PRE did hurt in the final, but his OBF made the deck much more efficient.  Probably good that there's no 6- or 7-cap Barons with OBF/PRE in this grouping.
