Deck Name: Muussauskoulu
Description: Thank you to Antti Penttilä for providing a great list that I customized by adding some rushes.
Antti got an idea of using Raw Recruit + As the Crow + Codex of the Edenic Groundskeepers with the intent of
actually removing vampires instead of just torporizing them and to turn objectives into assets.
