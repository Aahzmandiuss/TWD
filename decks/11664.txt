Description: All credit for the deck to my friend Bram, who is the mastermind behind this deck. It was a great pity that you didn't get to play in EC yourself. I didn't know how to describe the deck so I asked Bram for comments on this. His words of wisdom were "Bang Bang! DonÂ´t try this at home."
