Deck Name: All Gas
Comments: This engine sets an incredible pace!

Huge shout out to Darby and Karl, both of whom were kind enough to suggest removing the reaction package from the 90-card version I played in the Gulf Port GP final. Cheers Gents, the next round is on me!

I also dropped the Ravnos equipment/retainers, 2 A.I.s and reworked the stealth to add Elder Impersonation (came up big all day).

Also a special thank you to The Water Dog for taking the day off and giving the rest of us a chance!
