Deck Name: Proto Baron Deathstar
Comments: Some days the stars align, your deck runs great and things just go your way. Other times you can play your best deck, have a great day and still get beat due to mistakes/circumstances/vtes hard. And then every once in a while, you can just get lucky.

I limped into the final on TPs w/ 2.5 & 0 where I was getting soundly thrashed by Chance (Ravnos). Meanwhile Dean (Tremere bruiser) was doing the same to Sagan (also Ravnos). When I got down to 2 pool my prey, Brad (baron gun wall) agreed to help me back-oust Chance via Rev Council (because who wants a Break the Bonds predator?)

This gave Sagan 6 pool and bought me 2 or 3 turns off while Dean burned or torpored all her minions (tension). In the meantime Brad doesn't draw into any guns resulting in Dean torporing two of his Baron's. I caught the third with an agro-poke trying to rescue which left Brad with no ready minions.

HOWEVER I made a massive mistake/miscalc. and lost Branimira via blood hunt blocking/diablerizing a self-rescuing Baron (well played Dean!) But Dean's payload appeared to dry up for a minute and I fortunately survived the next turn to get a vp/6 pool. By that point Dean's minions were mostly spent, a well-timed agro-poke or two (tension) and some stealth sealed the deal. Right place, right time...
