Deck Name: Fine Purge v3
Description: Thanks to Jorge Delgado and Iñaki Jimenez for being always there when we discussed about decks. Lots of iterations of this deck and the version with wennie dom vampires around Montano was the chosen one for the day. Only change I’d do is to add 2 more Freak Drive and go to 65 cards, but really the decks works very well as it is. Just let the predator of your predator to get their VP and aim for GW3 or GW4, never for the sweep as you need a player to be happy getting 1vp and not ousting you cross table in order to win.
