-- 3GW9 + 1.5 in final (won in tiebreaker)

Deck Name: Matasuntha - The Evil One wins again (O mau vence novamente)
Description: The table featured Brujah explosive combat, Ministry, Tzimisce Den of Fiends wall combat, Toreador wall guns, and Gangrel Grinder. The Ministry deck clashed against the wall combat, unable to break through. The Brujah deck spent 80% of the game rushing backwards, while the Toreador deck, unlucky, remained passive as hand jammed and the deck failed. After the Ministry was ousted, the Tzimisce began aiding the Brujah against me. Both the Brujah and Toreador decks were ousted nearly simultaneously, and in the end, I was gaining more pool than the Tzimisce could bleed away, with several recursive locations and blood engines, securing my victory. The world is cruel, and life is unfair. (O mundo é mau e a vida injusta).
