-- 3GW12 + 4vp in final

Deck Name: O MAL Venceu

The final table was in the following order: Me (Arika with Obfuscate), a Ministry deck, a Tegyrius grinder, a Blood Brother bloat & bleed, and a Gangrel grinder. The game started with the Blood Brother bringing out three minions and diablerizing his prey's Gangrel first minion and then burning in the blood hunt. I started slowly, but played most of the game without a predator since he couldn't block my stealth. The Ministry exhausted itself completely trying to oust Tegyrius, who was just trying to survive. Finally, I eliminated the Ministry, though Tegyrius managed to score a VP with a Telepathic Misdirection, but unfortunately for him, he was left with all his minions tapped and was ousted on my turn, leaving me only with the Gangrel grinder, who had already been worn down by the Blood Brother. Dreams of the Sphinx and Arika's special unlocked my path to victory.
