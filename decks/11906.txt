Deck Name: Flipmode is the greatest!

Description:
"Knowing as a shorty, I was always told
That if I ain't gon' be part of the greatest
I gotta be the greatest myself."

The seating in finales:
First Dusan Kosanovic: "Dragos wall"
Nikica Novaković: "Lazverinus wall"
Djordje Šutić: "Trujah toolbox"
Miloš Krstić: "Flipmode is the greatest!"
Goran Damjanic: "Sébastien Goulet"
As we can see, two wall deks, with Flipmode "toolbox" if we can call it that, were in the final.
From the start, Goran was in a hard place, as Dragos did make it out fast, with Smiling Jack protected at the start.
With a slow grind, Jack didn't leave much room for others to play, The first to go down was Djordje Sutic, followed by Goran and Nikica.
Unfortunately pool gain from Milos and Dusan made it a slow race. As both players were left without cards in the end, the only thing left it to clock out, taking the full 2:30 min to the end.
