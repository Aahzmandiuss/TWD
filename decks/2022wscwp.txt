Deck Name: Capuchin and Gerald - Masks and Hoods
Description: This one started as a mind rape deck but was unsuccessfull. This version is more defense oriented which is strong strong side of the deck. Offense is also very good, especially in low intercept meta. And Gerald and Capuchin specials are just amazing!
Need to cut out at least 10 cards.
